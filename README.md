### Main types of computer classes:
- Embedded Computers
- Personal Computers (PC)
- Servers and Cloud 
- Super Computers
Each of those computers grows in compute power, storage, and size as we go down the list.

### 8 great ideas in computer architecture
- Design for (Gordon) Moore's law
- Use abstraction to simplify design
- Make the common case fast
- Hierarchy of memories
- Performance via parallelism
- Performance via pipelining
- Performance via prediction
- Dependability via redundancy
